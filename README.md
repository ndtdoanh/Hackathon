- Key entities: User, UserProfile, Role, Permission, ActivityLog, etc.
- Handles authentication and authorization via Identity Service.
3. **Hackathon Service**:
- Manages hackathon creation, rounds, locations, and event scheduling.
- Handles team formation, mentorship requests, and sponsorship management.
- Key entities: Hackathon, Team, Event, MentorshipRequest, Sponsorship, etc.
4. **Submission Service**:
- Handles project submissions and file uploads.
- Manages judge rounds, evaluation, and scoring criteria.
- Key entities: Submission, JudgeSubmission, RoundMarkCriterion, etc.
5. **Communication Service**:
- Provides messaging, notifications, discussion forums, and task management.
- Manages event scheduling and reminders.
- Key entities: Notification, Conversation, Task, ForumThread, ScheduleEvent, etc.
6. **Analytics Service**:

### Frontend (NextJS):
1. **Dashboard (Admin, Organizer, Judge)**:
- Provides an intuitive UI for managing hackathons, evaluating projects, and viewing analytics.
- Fetches real-time data from backend services via API Gateway.
2. **Participant Portal**:
- Allows users to register, join teams, and submit projects.
- Integrated with Hackathon Service and Submission Service.
3. **Mentorship & Forum**:
- Enables mentorship requests, booking sessions, and discussions.
- Connected to Communication Service for real-time chat, discussions, and mentor scheduling.
4. **Submission Service**:
- Displays system alerts, mentorship updates, event changes, and deadline reminders.
- Fetches data from Notification Service (Kafka-based event-driven architecture).

### Shared Services:
1. **Database**:
- MySQL: Structured data storage for all core microservices.
- Redis: Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., user sessions, event schedules).
2. **Messaging/Queue**:
- Kafka: Asynchronous event-driven communication (e.g., notifications, mentorship requests, submissions).
3. **Cloud Services - AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)**:
- EC2: Deploy API Gateway & microservices.
- S3: Store project submissions, images, and resources.
- RDS (MySQL): Managed database service for scalability.
4. **Containerization & Orchestration**:
